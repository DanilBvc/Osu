# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Environment variables set up

In the project directory, you need to place a ".env.local" file and configure the following variables:

```javascript
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY = 
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN = 
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = 
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET = 
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID = 
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID = 
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
